## Overview
The ToDo App is a responsive task management application built using React. It allows users to efficiently manage their tasks with features such as task addition, completion, deletion, editing, filtering, prioritization, and dark mode.

## Features

   - Input field and "Add" button to create tasks.
   - Tasks can have priorities: High, Medium, or Low.

2. **Mark Task as Complete**
   - Checkbox to toggle task completion.
   - Completed tasks are styled differently.

3. **Delete a Task**
   - Delete button to remove tasks.

4. **Edit an Existing Task**
   - Edit button to modify task content.

5. **Filter Tasks**
   - Filter tasks by All, Completed, or Incomplete.

6. **Persist Tasks with LocalStorage**
   - Tasks are saved in LocalStorage and loaded on app startup.

7. **Responsive Design + Dark Mode**
   - Mobile-first layout for seamless use on all devices.
   - Dark mode toggle for better accessibility.

8. **Task Priority + Sorting**
   - Tasks are sorted by priority (High → Medium → Low).
   - Priority is displayed alongside task names.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React (with JSX), CSS
